I will read `notes/.tmp/team-review-standard.md` to understand the instructions.
I will read the remaining content of `notes/.tmp/team-review-standard.md`.
I will create the review file `notes/CR-LATTICE-INIT-Gemini-Standard-20260214-1245.md` with my assessment.
I have completed the code review as instructed.

**Review File:** `notes/CR-LATTICE-INIT-Gemini-Standard-20260214-1245.md`

**Summary:**
The codebase establishes a solid foundation for the Lattice project, strictly adhering to the architectural principles of atomic writes and deterministic configuration. The separation of concerns between core logic, storage, and CLI is well-maintained.

**Key Findings:**
- **No Blockers** or **Important** issues found.
- **Potential:**
    1.  `src/lattice/storage/fs.py`: `tempfile.mkstemp` creates files with `0600` permissions. Verify if wider read permissions are needed for shared deployments.
    2.  `src/lattice/cli/main.py`: The `init` command's idempotency check is simple (existence of `.lattice` directory). Consider handling partial initialization states in future iterations.
    3.  `src/lattice/storage/fs.py`: `atomic_write` ensures data durability but does not strictly `fsync` the parent directory, which is acceptable for this tool but worth noting for strict POSIX compliance.
