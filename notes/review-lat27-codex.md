# Code Review: LAT-27 — LICENSE

**Verdict:** LGTM

## Findings
1. **MIT text correctness/completeness:** The LICENSE content matches the standard MIT License text and includes all required clauses (permission grant, inclusion condition, and warranty/liability disclaimer) with no substantive modifications.
2. **Copyright line format:** `Copyright (c) 2026 Stage 11 Agentics Corporation` is present and correctly formatted.
3. **Whitespace/encoding hygiene:** No trailing whitespace detected; file encoding is `us-ascii` (`text/plain`), line endings are LF, and EOF formatting is normal.

## Notes
- No changes requested.
