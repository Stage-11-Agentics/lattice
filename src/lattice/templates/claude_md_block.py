## Lattice

> **MANDATORY: This project has Lattice initialized (`.lattice/` exists). You MUST use Lattice to track all work. Creating tasks, updating statuses, and following the workflow below is not optional — it is a hard requirement. Failure to track work in Lattice is a coordination failure: other agents and humans cannot see, build on, or trust untracked work. If you are about to write code and no Lattice task exists for it, stop and create one first.**

Lattice is file-based, event-sourced task tracking built for minds that think in tokens and act in tool calls. The `.lattice/` directory is the coordination state — it lives alongside the code, not behind an API.

### Creating Tasks (Non-Negotiable)

Before you plan, implement, or touch a single file — the task must exist in Lattice. This is the first thing you do when work arrives.

```
lattice create "<title>" --actor agent:<your-id>
```

**Create a task for:** Any work that will produce commits — features, bugs, refactors, cleanup, pivots.

**Skip task creation only when:** The work is a sub-step of a task you're already tracking (lint fixes within your feature, test adjustments from your change), pure research with no deliverable, or work explicitly scoped under an existing task.

When in doubt, create the task. A small task costs nothing. Lost visibility costs everything.

### Descriptions Carry Context

Descriptions tell *what* and *why*. Plan files tell *how*.

- **Fully specified** (bug located, fix named, files identified): skip `in_planning`, go straight to `in_progress`. Mark `complexity: low`.
- **Clear goal, open implementation**: go through `in_planning`. Figure out the approach.
- **Decision context from conversations**: bake decisions and rationale into the description — without it, the next agent re-derives what was already decided.

### Status Transitions

Every transition is an immutable, attributed event. **The cardinal rule: update status BEFORE you start the work, not after.** If the board says `backlog` but you're actively working, the board is lying and every mind reading it makes decisions on false information.

```
lattice status <task> <status> --actor agent:<your-id>
```

```
backlog → in_planning → planned → in_progress → review → done
                                       ↕            ↕
                                    blocked      needs_human
```

**Transition discipline:**
- `in_planning` — before you open the first file to read. Then write the plan.
- `planned` — only after the plan file has real content.
- `in_progress` — before you write the first line of code.
- `review` — when implementation is complete, before review starts. Then actually review.
- `done` — only after a review has been performed and recorded.
- Spawning a sub-agent? Update status in the parent context first.

### The Planning Gate

The plan file lives at `.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md` — scaffolded on creation, empty until you fill it.

When you move to `in_planning`: open the plan file, write scope/approach/key files/acceptance criteria (a single sentence for trivial tasks, thorough for substantial work), then move to `planned` only when it reflects what you intend to build.

**The test:** If you moved to `planned` and the plan file is still empty scaffold, you didn't plan. Write the plan, or skip `in_planning` honestly with `--force --reason "trivial task, no planning needed"`.

### The Review Gate

Moving to `review` is a commitment to actually review the work.

When you move to `review`: identify what changed, perform a real code review (use `/exit-review` or `/code_review` for substantial work; focused self-review for trivial work), and record findings with `lattice comment`.

**When moving to `done`:** If the completion policy blocks you for a missing review artifact, do the review. Do not `--force` past it. `--force --reason` is for genuinely exceptional cases, not a convenience shortcut.

**The test:** If you moved to `review` and then `done` with nothing in between, you skipped the review — the exact failure mode this gate prevents.

### When You're Stuck

Use `needs_human` when you need human decision, approval, or input. This is distinct from `blocked` (generic external dependency) — it creates a scannable queue.

```
lattice status <task> needs_human --actor agent:<your-id>
lattice comment <task> "Need: <what you need, in one line>" --actor agent:<your-id>
```

Use for: design decisions requiring human judgment, missing access/credentials, ambiguous requirements, approval gates.

### Actor Attribution

Every operation requires `--actor`. Attribution follows authorship of the *decision*, not the keystroke.

- Agent decided autonomously → `agent:<id>`
- Human typed it directly → `human:<id>`
- Human meaningfully shaped the outcome → `human:<id>` (agent was the instrument)

When in doubt, credit the human.

### Branch Linking

Link feature branches to tasks: `lattice branch-link <task> <branch-name> --actor agent:<your-id>`. Auto-detection works when the branch contains the short code (e.g., `feat/LAT-42-login`), but explicit linking is preferred.

### Leave Breadcrumbs

You are not the last mind that will touch this work. Use `lattice comment` for what you tried, chose, and left undone. Use `plans/<task_id>.md` for structured plans and `notes/<task_id>.md` for working notes and context dumps. The record you leave is the only bridge to the next agent's context.

### Quick Reference

```
lattice create "<title>" --actor agent:<id>
lattice status <task> <status> --actor agent:<id>
lattice assign <task> <actor> --actor agent:<id>
lattice comment <task> "<text>" --actor agent:<id>
lattice link <task> <type> <target> --actor agent:<id>
lattice branch-link <task> <branch> --actor agent:<id>
lattice next [--actor agent:<id>] [--claim]
lattice show <task>
lattice list
```

**Useful flags:**
- `--quiet` — prints only the task ID (scripting: `TASK=$(lattice create "..." --quiet)`)
- `--json` — structured output: `{"ok": true, "data": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": ...}`
- `lattice list --status in_progress` / `--assigned agent:<id>` / `--tag <tag>` — filters
- `lattice link <task> subtask_of|depends_on|blocks <target>` — task relationships
